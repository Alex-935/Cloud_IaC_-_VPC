Make VPC main.tf working

    Test with hardcoded values
    Move over to use variavle.tf for as many values as possible
    Move over to using tfvars --> Prod vs testing?


Make GitHub Repo main.tf working

    Use variables/tf vars after you test hardcoded values
    Can you extend this in terms of functionality
    Document as you see fit


Other TF projects

    ASG and LB?
    VPC with app and db (posts page) deployment
    TF Modules?
